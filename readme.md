To achieve the requirement where the uploaded file is not stored on your Flask application's server but instead processed and returned to the user, you can follow a structured approach using client-side storage and processing along with server-side handling. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Frontend (Client-Side)

#### File Upload
Allow users to upload files using an HTML form with `input type="file"`.

#### File Processing (Client-Side)
Use JavaScript to read the file contents and handle the upload process. Instead of storing the file in the server's filesystem, you'll keep it in memory (or local storage) until it's sent to the server for processing.
